1. See a set of Instructions on how to play and give credits to Koding for the initiative. Talk about the aim of the game as a way to challenge the thinking of students and also encourage practical applications of physics in our day-to-day activities.

2. Choose to start with single player or multi-player.

3. The first stage of the game, 
  1. The player sees a tag name on the player e.g   Force
		    																					   +++__+++
    -- To complete it within 2 seconds, he needs to choose an quantity that       
        best completes the equation e.g pick "acceleration" given   Mass
																																   ++__++
        on the other side. Time taken to answer matters and gives you an edge 	
       in the final rank table;
     The loop continues with movement of equations on both sides (animated) 
     and a question mark(?) to denote the missing element to complete the   
     equation.
  2. The available options to pick from include seeing an animated    
        vertical scroll of elements with the representation e.g 
       acceleration(a).    OR
         We can make the user type in the answer (anyone works).
     
4. The loop continues till the time given is exhausted.
5. A scorecard is shown to see the number of correct and incorrect answers
6. Two options
  1. You can choose to view the missed answers (solution) which 
          typically involves: 
    1. -- Reading a bit about the equation before previewing the   
                   correct answer. 
  2. Play the game again.
7. Show the global ranking of PhyGamers.

Amendments and suggestions are welcome.
